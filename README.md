Attempt to write a program to convert denary numbers to roman numerals

I have noticed that although techincally correct (even IIIIIIIII... is correct for a number) the program does not yet use IV for 4 and so on and so is not writing the roman numerals as fast and simply as they can be written. I am currently working on making the program write the roman numerals as fast and simply as possible as writing n(I) would be easy.

However, there is no genius way of doing this as all you can do is compare the number imputted with smaller and smaller values, taking away the biggest one at a time, allowing the number to be written as a sum of the biggest values possible. However, dealing with VI and terms like this does add a bit of complexity.

After this I plan to attempt to write a program to convert numerals back to denary.
