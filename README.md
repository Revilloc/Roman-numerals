Attempt to write a program to convert denary numbers to roman numerals

I have noticed that although techincally correct (even IIIIIIIII... is correct for a number) the program does not yet use IV for 4 and so on and so is not writing the roman numerals as fast and simply as they can be written. I am currently working on making the program write the roman numerals as fast and simply as possible as writing n(I) would be easy.

After this I plan to attempt to write a program to convert them back
