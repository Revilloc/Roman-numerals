# Roman-numerals
Attempt to write a program to convert denary numbers to roman numerals

I have noticed that although techincally correct (even IIIIIIIII... is correct for a number) the program does not yet use IV for 4 and so on and so is not writing the roman numerals as fast as they can be written. I am currently working on this.
